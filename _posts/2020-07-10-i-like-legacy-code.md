Sometimes I have to help people work on so-called Legacy Code, which is loosely defined as _code that developers are afraid to change_. Over on the company site I [wrote a blog post](https://twinklebob.co.uk/web-development/2020/07/10/in-defence-legacy-code/) about dealing with legacy code.

> A lot of developers, at the mere smell of legacy code will shout to redevelop from scratch, to seek out the latest new shiny and rebuild the product from the ground up. There can be benefits to that, for sure, but it isn’t the only way. I’m almost a fence sitter on this one, but if pushed I’d probably fall on the _Maintain Legacy_ side of the fence. I don’t think it’s a black and white decision, though.

If you didn't already know, I'm a web developer contractor. I work mostly with other development companies to either build what they can't or to help them build it quicker and better.

I sometimes post about subjects relating to my work on that blog, and sometimes post them here, it depends which way the wind is blowing that day. The more technical stuff is more likely to land here though.
