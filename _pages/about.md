I'm David and pretty much everything that's interesting about me can be summed up with the keywords from the subtitle :point_up:.

## Christian

I grew up in The Salvation Army and my faith has been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember.

More recently I have found myself reassessing the fundamentals of my faith and stripping back everything that didn't matter. It's been a difficult process, because a lot of my life was built on top of that stack and without all the layers it's become a little wobbly while I adjust.

## Father/Husband

:bride_with_veil: I'm married to Lucy, we married in 2008.

:family: In 2011 I became the father of Isaac.

:dog2: In 2015 we "adopted" Willow, our Labrador.

## Geek

I love playing with technology of all kinds. I also love geeking out on how things work. Most of my projects are either about finding how something works or trying to fix something. I'm always trying to fix things... :hammer:

I'm particularly found of:

* Gadgets
* Electric Cars
* Automating

## Programming Wizard

In reality this is just a subset of the above, but I love solving software problems and I'm grateful that I get to do it for money. In 2016 I left full time employment and became a freelancer/contractor (see my profiles at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlumm/) and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/story/1016336)). These days I mostly work with PHP.

I also have a bit of an interest in business analysis and I enjoy helping smaller companies with their processes as they go through the growing pains of becoming a medium or large business (see [TwinkleBob Solutions](http://twinklebob.co.uk)).
