Did you watch any of the 1900 Island series on the BBC? If you didn't, I highly recommend binging it on iPlayer. It follows 4 families as they leave behind the trappings of the modern world in favour of life in a 1900 welsh fishing village.

It's a great series and I think it has a lot to teach us. The format is well known now, the BBC have done quite a few of these programmes and they're popular. I think there's a good reason for that, which we'll get to. Don't be put off and think you've you've seen it all before!

Over the course of a month the four families face hardship, hard-work and hard lessons. It's not easy. Finally, in the last week the families must face the "progress" offered by the industrial revolution and mechanisation. It was a killer for families and communities like that back then, but we know now with hindsight that it was also a killer for our fishstocks. More more more eventually turned into less less less.

Recently we also got the chance to visit a Tudor re-enactment, with people living as they would have lived in the late Tudor period. For the ordinary person not much had changed significantly between those periods. It got me thinking, what would someone from one of those communities think of the way we live?

A family lived in a single kitchen/dining/living room, and often shared a single bedroom. They cooked and warmed the house using a single solid fuel stove that had to be kept burning all day and night.

People worked hard, for often little reward. They had to do all their chores manually, nearly all of their work was physical. There weren't many medicines and illnesses that we would think of as insignificant today would have been at the best disruptive and at the worst fatal. All this to say, I know it's easy to over-romanticise the past, but I also know it wasn't all rosy.

A lot of the transformation in the way people lived came from the rapid mechanisation of the industrial age, and the consumerism that developed from that. Something that a person had to work months to afford became cheaper as they could be farmed/fished/made in increasing bulk. For instance, the small fishing communities that were emulated on the the TV programme simply couldn't keep up with the steam trawlers who could catch more and stay out longer.

However, we now understand that not everything that promised progress was for the best in the long run. All those trawlers have caused so many problems in the ecosystem of our seas.

What if we could start again from the simplicity of pre-industrialisation and add on what we now know? Apply the most modern of technology? Would this allow us to lead simpler lives without too many hard compromises?

Imagine that simple life, without too many concerns, but with electricity, running water, a washing machine, a fridge/freezer, maybe even a microwave. No cars, because everything you need is nearby.

The more I think about it, the more I realise that people are already making this shift. The tiny house movement, digital nomads, people going "off-grid", counter-culture communities etc.

It seems that turning your back on some of the modern world doesn't require a complete denial of all the good progress of the last hundred years. It doesn't need to be like the film [The Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_(2004_film)). Instead we can take the time to decide which things we consider progress and which are ultimately damaging to humanity or the world. The good news is that thanks to the colourful nature of humanity, each persons compromises could be very different.

For me, I'm realising that it's hard to break free of old habits and old measures of success, especially when you become more established. I can imagine that the next generation will be much freer of the trappings of modernity than my generation.

I've thought about and [written about]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-02-how-avoid-capitalism-community %}) these sorts of things for ages, but the reality is it's hard to make those changes sometimes. It's much easier to start off that way.

What from the modern world would you be willing to compromise on? What could you never let go of?
