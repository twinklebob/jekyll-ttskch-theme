Did you watch any of the 1900 Island series on the BBC? If you didn't, I highly recommend binging it on iPlayer. It follows 4 families as they leave behind the trappings of the modern world in favour of life in a 1900 welsh fishing village.

It's a great series and I think it has a lot to teach us. The format is well known now, the BBC have done quite a few of these programmes and they're popular. I think there's a good reason for that, which we'll get to. Don't be put off and think you've you've seen it all before!

Over the course of a month the four families face hardship, hard-work and hard lessons. It's not easy. Finally, in the last week the families must face the "progress" offered by the industrial revolution and mechanisation. It was a killer for families and communities like that back then, but we know now with hindsight that it was also a killer for our fishstocks. More more more eventually turned into less less less.

Recently we also got the chance to visit a Tudor re-enactment, with people living as they would have lived in the late Tudor period. For the ordinary person not much had changed significantly between those periods. It got me thinking, what would someone from one of those communities think of the way we live?

A family lived in a single kitchen/dining/living room, and often shared a single bedroom. They cooked and warmed the house using a single solid fuel stove that had to be kept burning all day and night.

People worked hard, for often little reward. They had to do all their chores manually, nearly all of their work was physical. There weren't many medicines and illnesses that we would think of as insignificant today would have been at the best disruptive and at the worst fatal.
