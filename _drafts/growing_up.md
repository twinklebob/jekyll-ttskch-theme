It's May 2019. That means it's more than 7.5 years since Isaac was born. It doesn't seem that long.

The other night I helped him off to sleep, which I have done most nights since he was 6 months old and will continue to do until he gets fed up with me. It's not always easy and it's not unusual for me to fall asleep before he does, which can be frustrating, but I'm not giving up those moments of holding hands with him, having random conversations (and telling him to stop talking and go to sleep :joy:) and saying goodnight. I'm not giving them up until he's ready.

But this particular night was different. I was wondering how much longer he'll want to do this with me. I don't anticipate it being long until he decides he's happy to go to sleep on his own with just his teddies (and possibly Willow) for company. Given what I've read of other co-sleepers it may not be very far away.

It made me emotional that night and it's making me emotional again writing about it. Those years just fly by. All those difficult days, through teething or fierce toddler independence, all those times we thought to ourselves "will this ever end?" whilst reminding ourselves
