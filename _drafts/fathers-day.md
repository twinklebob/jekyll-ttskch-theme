Our Father's Day started fairly quietly, but turned out to be a bit of a surprise. We'd been watching the weather through the week and making a few plans and backup plans for the day and then Isaac woke up not feeling great on top of that the weather looked worse than we had expected.

Thankfully Isaac improved quickly and we were able to think of something to salvage the rest of the day. We decided that a National Trust property made sense, as we're members, and that we wanted to try a new one. Ideally we were hoping to find one where we could take Willow, but it's not always possible.

A quick search on the National Trust website (which works really well) showed us a few options. We eventually decided to give Barrington Court a try, which was only about an hour from us.

We didn't know anything about Barrington Court short of the short blurb on the website. What we found there totally blew us away.

When we got there the car park was rammed because they were having a jazz concert on the south lawn. They managed to squeeze us in, but I don't think they were used to having quite so many people there.

The grounds were fantastic and beautiful, but we took a quick stroll through and made our way to the restaurant. The restaurant was in the Strode House which started life as a stable block! As a National Trust restaurant it was unusual. It's made up of a series of smaller rooms and there is no serving hatch. You pick a table, go to the (single) till and place your order, including drinks. The only thing that is self service is cakes and water.

Despite there being so many people there, the service was quick and painless and the food was very good. Some of the ingredients were even grown onsite, which was very exciting.

It was the house, however, that really blew us away. It was originally built in Elizabeth times, but had a rough history including fires which left it in a sorry state. Part of it were used as a farmhouse, parts used as storage for cider barrels etc and parts weren't fit for human habitation and were filled with owls and bats.

At a time when other grand houses were being demolished the National Trust was just getting started in it's mission of saving as many as possible. They took on Barrington Court and it could've been their greatest mistake. It was too far gone and the renovations required were too much for the fledging Trust to take on. In fact the story goes that "Barrington Court" became a warning phrase used when the Trust considered other such houses for decades after.
