Our Father's Day started fairly quietly, but turned out to be a bit of a surprise. We'd been watching the weather through the week and making a few plans and backup plans for the day and then Isaac woke up not feeling great on top of that the weather looked worse than we had expected.

Thankfully Isaac improved quickly and we were able to think of something to salvage the rest of the day. We decided that a National Trust property made sense, as we're members, and that we wanted to try a new one. Ideally we were hoping to find one where we could take Willow, but it's not always possible.

A quick search on the National Trust website (which works really well) showed us a few options. We eventually decided to give Barrington Court a try, which was only about an hour from us.

We didn't know anything about Barrington Court short of the short blurb on the website. What we found there totally blew us away.
