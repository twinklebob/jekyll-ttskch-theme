I read an article recently about the [Top Ten PHP frameworks](https://dzone.com/articles/top-10-php-frameworks-for-web-development) that listed the frameworks in order of popularity (although I'm not sure of the source of that data) and outlined some of their strengths.

I've used a few of the frameworks on the list to some extent or another (3 out of the top 4) and whilst there are definitely things I like about front runners Laravel and Symfony there are times when I wonder if they're a bit over complicated for the majority of web development.

As well as what are probably the big two these days, I've also used Slim (mostly for building APIs), which I enjoyed using and I've also used CodeIgniter.

One interesting thing about this article is that it paints CodeIgniter in quite a good light. In my experience the developers who use it a lot really like it, and everyone else tends to look down on it for being a bit too flexible. I can understand the concern, but that flexibility can be really powerful if treated with respect.

One thing I do particularly like about CodeIgniter is that it doesn't use a templating language. PHP already _is_ essentially a templating language, so why introduce the overhead of another one?

Btw, I've seen this trick on some other webpages that I enjoy reading (particularly recently [CSS Tricks](css-tricks.com)) where they have brief articles that send you off elsewhere. As I start to withdraw from social media it looks like an interesting way to share other content that I find across the interwebs. So that's what this is and I'll probably be doing it more.
