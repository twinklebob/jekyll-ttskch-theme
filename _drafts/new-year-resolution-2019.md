Looking back it's clear to see that 2018 has been a great year for me and for us as a family. There's lots to be thankful for and still lots to look forward to in 2019.

It's traditional at this time to set yourself some goals for the year ahead. So here are mine.

This year I want to Read More, Write More and Play More.

## Read More

Every year I do the Goodreads reading challenge, this year is no exception. But, with the exception of 2015 - where I gave myself the pitiful target of 6 books in a year, I've never managed to quite do it. This year I've set myself the target of 16 books, my highest yet, that's 1.5 a month, and I'm determined to smash it!

Plus I'm [reading through the Bible](/search/?t=bible-in-a-year) this year again too!

## Write More

I enjoy writing, trying to convert thoughts into words, especially words you can share with someone, is quite hard! I've been maintaining a blog for a very long time, but I've never really been very good at making the most of it. So part of this goal is to use the blog more.

I'm setting myself the fairly realistic goal of one post a month, but I really ought ot be able to do better than that if I try a little bit. I've got a couple of draft posts that I've never quite finished, and I'm hoping to repost some content from older blogs, perhaps with some updates.

Another target for more writing, and a tool that should help me when planning blog posts, is my journal. I've managed to complete 3 months bullet journalling - admittedly I mostly use it as a combination todo/planner, but I'm hoping to begin to add more content. Generally I engage with it in the morning and the evening, looking ahead or looking back, but if I can start to use it more during the day, I think that will help.

## Play more

This one's just about having more fun. Trying to spend more time in the moment and enjoy every single one of those moments with my family. Things can change in an instant and I don't want to miss a thing!

The last couple of years have been hard as I built up the business and tried to restore some sort of stability amongst a raft of changes in our lives. Things should be more settled now, so hopefully I can relax a little and enjoy it.

What about you? What are your hopes, goals and dreams for 2019?
