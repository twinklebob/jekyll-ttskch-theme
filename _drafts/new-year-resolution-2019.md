Looking back it's clear to see that 2018 has been a great year for me and for us as a family. There's lots to be thankful for and still lots to look forward to in 2019.

This year I want to Read More, Write More and Play More.

## Read More

Every year I do the Goodreads reading challenge, this year is no exception. But, with the exception of 2015 - where I gave myself the pitiful target of 6 books in a year, I've never managed to quite do it. This year I've set myself the target of 16 books, that's 1.5 a month, and I'm determined to smash it!

Plus I'm [reading through the Bible](/search/?t=bible-in-a-year) this year again too!

## Write More
