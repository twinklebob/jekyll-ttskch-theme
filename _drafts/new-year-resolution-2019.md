Looking back it's clear to see that 2018 has been a great year for me and for us as a family. There's lots to be thankful for and still lots to look forward to in 2019!

It's traditional at this time to set yourself some goals for the year ahead. So here are mine.

This year I want to _Read More_, _Write More_ and _Play More_.

## Read More

For the past few years I have attempted the [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/cyberneticiandave) reading challenge, this year will be no different. I've never managed to quite do it, with the exception of 2015 - where I only gave myself the pitiful target of 6 books in a year. This year I've set myself the target of 16 books, my highest yet, that's one and a half books a month, and I'm determined to smash it!

I'll be [reading through the Bible](/search/?t=bible-in-a-year) this year again too! This year I'm using the [Read Scripture](https://www.readscripture.org/) app. It's looking like it will pick up the best parts of the plan I was reading in 2018, although it doesn't have the same community features. I'll probably have some feedback in a couple of weeks.

## Write More

I've always enjoyed writing. The process of trying to convert thoughts into words, especially words you can share with someone, can be quite hard but at the same time it can also be very rewarding!

I've been maintaining a blog, in some form or another, for a very long time but I've not always been very good at making the most of it. I've been particularly rubbish the last few years. So part of this goal is to use the blog more.

I'm setting myself the fairly realistic goal of one post a month, but I really ought to be able to do better than that if I try a little bit. I've got a couple of draft posts that I've never quite finished, and I'm hoping to repost some content from older blogs, perhaps with some updates.

Another target for more writing, and a tool that should help me when planning blog posts, is my journal. I've managed to complete 3 months bullet journalling - admittedly I mostly use it as a combination todo/planner, but I'm hoping to begin to add more content. Generally I engage with it in the morning and the evening, looking ahead or looking back, but if I can start to use it more during the day, I think that will help.

## Play more

This one's just about having more fun. Trying to spend more time in the moment and enjoy every single one of those moments with my family. Things can change in an instant and I don't want to miss a thing!

The last couple of years have been hard as I built up the business and tried to restore some sort of stability amongst a raft of changes in our lives. Things should be more settled now, so hopefully I can relax a little and remember to enjoy it!

What about you? What are your hopes, goals and dreams for 2019?
