For Christmas Isaac was given a ticket to see the Horrible Histories: Awful Egyptians show at the theatre by his auntie and uncle. They both bought tickets and so did we. Last week I took a day off and we went to The Playhouse in Weston-super-Mare to watch it together and we had a great time!

We were trying to work out when Isaac first started watching the Horrible Histories TV programme and he may well have been around 3 or 4. He found it hilarious at the time and we figured that at least it was educational.
