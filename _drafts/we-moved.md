Cornwall is a very special place to us. We've spent 8 of our 9 years of marriage living there and our son was born there and has lived there for over 5 years. It wasn't an easy decision, but we decided that the time had come to move.

The decision wasn't an easy one to make, at the very least we had felt that we had moved to Cornwall with a purpose and that it would probably be our home for a long time to come, but we always knew that we would need to move at some point to be nearer to our parents in their dotage. It turned out, though, that family was more of a draw than we expected.

People who visit Cornwall for a week or two a year don't always realise just how remote it can be. For a lot of people it's this sense of removal from the busy-ness of life that brings them back year after year, after all.

Living there we accepted this and even embraced it the majority of the time, but it was difficult travelling to/from family, particularly during difficult times. We lived so far west that our journey out of Cornwall itself could take an hour.
