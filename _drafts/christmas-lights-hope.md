Taking down the Christmas decorations is hard. We took all ours down on Sunday. They've been up from the beginning of December and we didn't feel we could push them any further. It doesn't matter that the tree is starting to drop more and more needles, it was still hard to say goodbye.

Compared to putting the decorations up, taking them down is a much easier job, but the emotional incentive just isn't there. The decorations represent good things, and taking them down means the end of those good things.

Still, it could be worse. Mousehole Harbour Lights (pictured) take around 3 months to set up and are usually only up for about 3 weeks!
