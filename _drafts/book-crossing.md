It seems so long ago now that we were on the move again, back in September. This is a post I started back then and kept trying to finish, but never quite got a round to, but it's still something that I want to share.

This last move wasn't quite so far, or so stressful. Having tried the suburban/semi-rural life, and given ourselves a chance to settle back into a reasonably familiar area, we were ready to go back to a more rural setting. Living in Cornwall for so long changed our perspective so much.

Unlike the move from Cornwall we gave ourselves a bit more time and were able to think and plan a little more carefully about where we wanted to go and what we wanted take with us.

We have a **LOT** of books, including boxes of books we had previously stockpiled for carboot sales! We didn't want to move them again, so they were one of the things we tried to cut back on.

We didn't have time to sell them all, most of them had writing or things on them that would probably get them chucked out if donated to charity shop, so I decided that this was a great opportunity to look into [BookCrossing.com](BookCrossing.com).

I'm not sure when I first came across the website, but I loved the idea straight away. The basic premise is that books have a life of their own: you read a book and then you pass it on. But even better than that, you can follow the life of a book!

Every book is given a unique identifier (a BookCrossing ID or BCID) which you write or stick somewhere inside the front cover. Then you pass it on to someone, or you leave it in one of those little libraries in phone boxes or the like, or perhaps you just leave it in a public place for someone to find. The general idea is that whoever finds it then looks for it online and updates it's story. (So far I've only had one update on a book).

Back before we moved I paid for a months membership, got some pre-numbered labels printed and set about labelling, registering and releasing the books. At first I tried releasing in public places, but it scared me a bit that the book would never be found and read. So I then stuck with releasing in a couple of book sharing locations.

So far I've registered 65 books and released 47 of them, 43 of those were released into "the wild" as it's called on BookCrossing. You can follow my books on my [bookshelf](https://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/CyberneticDave/all).

In the end I only managed to mostly do the books that had never been ours in the first place. We still need to go through some of the others, so I'll hopefully be labelling and releasing some more soon, as we get ourselves more settled. I'd also love to have one of those little library boxes in our front garden or something, but we'll have to see about that.

If I get any interesting stories on any of my books, I'll be sure to share it here too!
