We've been on the move again. Not so far this time but, having tried the suburban/semi-rural life, we're ready to go back to a rural village. Living in Cornwall for so long changed our perspective so much.

Unlike the last move we had a bit more warning and were able to think a bit more carefully about what we take with us.

We have a **LOT** of books, including boxes of books we had previously stockpiled for carboot sales! So they're one of the things we tried to cut back on.
