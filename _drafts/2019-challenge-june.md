Earlier this year I set myself some goals, resolutions if you will, to try and push myself to do some of the things that I always want to do but always find excuses not to do.

It's been a while since I've made an update; the question is whether thats a bad sign or not? Let's take a look through my three goals: Read More, Write More, Play More.

## Read More

So I set myself the goal of reading 16 books this year, the biggest goal I've set myself in quite a while. I made a good start in the weeks/months following Christmas, but things have slowed down. I'm still on 4 books, reading my fifth. Worse still, I've been reading this book since the end of January!! It's been a long hard read, but I'm getting there and should hopefully finish this month. After this I'll be back onto a fiction book, so that should be easier to get finished.

However, my Bible in a year progress has been much better. I've been doing really well and really enjoying it again, although at the moment I'm a few days behind. It was just a series of event that interrupted my usual routine, but I'm catching up well now.

## Write More
