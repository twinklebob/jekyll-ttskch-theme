I don't know about you, but the long weekend seems so far away already. I wanted to quickly write about it before it completely fades from memory, but I took too long. We had a really great time.

Every couple of months we try to get down to see my parents in Cornwall. Somewhat by accident we planned this visit to coincide with the long weekend, so we were able to spend an extra day with them and the Cornish countryside. Sometimes we just enjoy the break from routine, but this time we managed to cram so much in. I just wanted to share an overview of a lovely weekend.

Our weekends in Cornwall always start with a lunchtime drive. The traffic at home can be awful at the end of the day, and much worse on a Friday; you can expect to double that for a long weekend or half-term, never mind the combination. It's one of the benefits to working for myself from home, I can take time out of the middle of the day and make it up later. Once we arrive, Isaac and Willow set to playing with Nanny, Grandad and Roo (the deaf cocker spaniel); meanwhile I get back to work.

After tea, before I finished up my work, we took a trip to Par beach. We've been here before, it's a great beach to bring the dogs, but I've never seen the tide out so far and it just kept going out!

We managed to explore so much of the beach, including waterfalls and rock pools which had only just been exposed. I've not been much good at taking pictures recently, but I managed to grab a couple including the one at the top of this post.

On Saturday we went out to [Trerice House and Gardens](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/trerice). As we're all National Trust members this was a fairly cheap day out (although we did visit the cafe and I can highly recommend the Lemon Meringue, even if it is bit pricey). We had forgotten we had visited before, but I don't think much of the house was open previously, so it was nice to take a look around some more of it.

Whilst in the great hall we saw a video of some men playing skittles on the path, Isaac was excited to find the exact skittles on display and was also excited to have a go with some replicas in the garden. That was good fun!

The gardens were lovely to walk around too. We were very blessed with the weather as it turned out much nicer that day than the forecast.

Another highlight was trying on some tudor costumes. Isaac is never one to pass up the opportunity to dress up, and Lucy was happy that some adult costumes had also been provided!

By the time we got back to my parents we were pretty tired and it looked as though it was about to rain. That's when we realised we had lost Isaac's jumper somewhere at Trerice! In my rush to go back and get it I left my jumper and coat. It rained whilst I drove there, but then it stopped whilst I wandered around and found the jumper (a very helpful volunteer also checked the lost property for me). As soon as I got back into the car it started raining again.

On Sunday we went to Cardinham Woods to meet with some old friends from St Ives. One of the children is just a few weeks younger than Isaac, which is how Lucy had come to know them. We had a great time, walking around, splashing in the river, playing in the park and of course eating lovely food from the [Woods Cafe](https://www.woodscafe.co.uk/)!

Later we went with my parents to one of the churches they look after to have a go at indoor bowling. It's something they do once a month, but none of the three of us had ever tried it. We didn't do very well, but we got better as the afternoon wore on. Isaac was the best, and I'm sure it had nothing to do with the extra tuition he was being offered, not that I'm jealous or anything.

Sunday evening finished with a trip to Mevagissey. It's obligatory when visiting my parents, but that doesn't make it any less special. We had a lovely evening for it, too!

Monday was our day to go home, but Pirate FMs traffic prediction suggested that we were better to drive either early or after 4, so we decided to go out for the morning. It was looking a lovely day, so we did a quick search of nearish beaches that allowed dogs and decided on Holywell Bay.
