I don't know about you, but the long weekend seems so far away already. I want to quickly write about it before it completely fades from memory. We had a great time.

Every couple of months we try to get down to see my parents in Cornwall. Somewhat by accident we planned this visit to coincide with the long weekend, so we were able to spend an extra day with them and the Cornish countryside. Sometimes we just enjoy the break from routine, but this time we managed to cram so much in. I just wanted to share an overview of a lovely weekend.

Our weekends in Cornwall always start with a lunchtime drive. The traffic at home can be awful at the end of the day, and much worse on a Friday; you can expect to double that for a long weekend or half-term, never mind the combination. It's one of the benefits to working for myself from home, I can take time out of the middle of the day and make it up later. Once we arrive, Isaac and Willow set to playing with Nanny, Grandad and Roo; meanwhile I get back to work.

After tea, before I finished up my work, we took a trip to Par beach. We've been here before, it's a great beach to bring the dogs, but I've never seen the tide out so far and it was still going out.

We managed to explore so much of the beach, including waterfalls and rock pools which had only just been exposed. I've not been much good at taking pictures recently, but I managed to grab a couple including the one at the top of this post.
