I've recently recommitted myself to trying to update this blog more often. But whenever I do that (and I've tried many times) it always raises some difficult questions. Mainly, what makes a blog a blog and: what sort of blog is this anyway?

I'm not entirely sure when I started blogging, my first blog(s) are long since lost. I reckon I spent a good few years on MSN Spaces before I switched to [Blogger](https://daveonthespot.blogspot.co.uk/). The blogger archive dates back to October 2007, so we're probably talking 15 years maybe? In all that time I've never managed to do it regularly and stick to a format.

I've never really had a goal or a theme for my blog, but I've always enjoyed blogging as an opportunity to write. To be honest, I'm never really sure that what I do is proper blogging. What is blogging anyway?

The word blog has been around on the internet for a pretty long time now. It was originally coined some time in the 1990s as a joining of the words **web** and **log** and was mostly an online journal of sorts. The blog predates modern social media, and a lot of early social media was still built around a blog being the key way to share updates (myspace, bebo, msn live spaces etc). Twitter was originally marketed as a micro-blogging service.

Blogs, unlike other types of webpage at the time, were easier to keep updated and designed for regular updates. It wasn't long before blogs started to be used for more than just sharing regular updates about the authors life, they also became an easy way for budding journalists to self-publish. These days blogs take many different formats, but I reckon that most blogs can be categorised in one of four ways:

## 1. Like a journal

These blogs are a way to create a record of your life. For some people they may not even necessarily be intended to be read, or might only be intended for friends and family. They are very personal and just talk about everyday things.

## 2. Like a column

The difference between a journal (albeit a public one) and a newspaper column is that the column has regular-spaced updates that are connected by a theme but are each centred on a different subject. These are generally written to build a following, because of that they might be a bit more "professional" than a journal (especially if it's been around a little while and has become part of the author's income).

## 3. Like articles

If I've learnt anything from *Marley and Me* it's that writing a column and writing articles are completely different things.

Although an article-based blog may still have a common theme (perhaps it's a car blog, a parenting blog or a religious one), the content will be a little more formal, more of a discussion of facts than personal experience. The individual posts might be a little longer and could be on a different subject each time. These are written to inform, educate and entertain (yes, I stole that [from the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/insidethebbc/whoweare/publicpurposes)).

## 4. Like editorials

Editorials fit somewhere between the columns and the articles. They allow the author a chance to comment on a topical issue, reflecting on the facts and their own opinions. Like a column they are written regularly for an audience that wants to hear the latest opinion from the author.

## So what about me?

The problem I've always had is that I've never been able to decide on a format. I enjoy some of the more journal-like blogs, and I'd love to write more like a columnist, but I don't write regularly enough and I don't know that I have an interesting enough life to write about it every week without boring people. Sometimes I want to write about other things, but in the end the only running theme my blog has is me and my life.

So, maybe I should just stick to writing articles? Whilst some of what I write might pass as an article at a stretch, I don't want to be restricted to only writing that format. In the end I think that's a big part of the problem that makes it harder to keep the blog updated. I don't have a particular purpose in writing, other than that I enjoy writing.

I'm not making any promises though, I've done that before and consistently failed to keep it up. I've not written this as an apology, more just an explanation of what this blog is supposed to be (or perhaps what it isn't).

That being said, these days I'm a lot less active on social-media, so maybe I could make more of an effort to share some highlights from my week?

At the very least, whilst I'm trying to write regular new content I'm also planning to repost some of my better content from blogging past.

I'd love to hear what you think about blogging. What sort of blogs do you enjoy reading? Can you think of any exceptions to my four categories?
