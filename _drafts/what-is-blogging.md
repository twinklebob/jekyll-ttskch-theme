I'm not entirely sure when I started blogging, my first blog(s) are long since lost. I spent a good few years on MSN Spaces before I switched to Blogger. I definitely remember blogging when I was at Uni, so that's at least 10 years. In all that time I've never managed to do it regularly and certainly never been able to make my living from it as some seem to.

I've never really had a goal or a theme for my blog, but I've always enjoyed blogging as an opportunity to write. To be honest, I'm never really sure that what I do is proper blogging, what is blogging anyway?

The word blog has been around on the internet for a pretty long time now. It was originally a joining of the words **web** and **log** and was mostly an online journal of sorts. This predates most social media, and a lot of early social media was still built around a blog being the key way to share updates (myspace, bebo, msn live spaces etc).

It wasn't long before blogs started to replicate writing styles found in the traditional media. I reckon that most blogs can be categorised in one of four ways:

1. Like a journal (not necessarily written to be read)
1. Like a column (regular related updates)
1. Like articles (more formal, factual, may be on a different subject each time)
1. Like editorials (more commentary than articles)

The problem I've always had is that I've never been able to decide on a format. I'd love to write more like a columnist, but I don't write regularly enough and I don't know that I have an interesting enough life to write about it every week without boring people. Plus sometimes I want to write about other things.

So, maybe I should just write articles? Well some of what I write could probably pass as articles, but what about the rest?

Normally in this sort of writing, that would be a rhetorical question that I would go on to answer, but the truth is I just don't know the answer. I'm guess I'm just happy to continue writing what I feel like, when I feel like it and to let this site be a collection of my writing, rather than a regular blog of a particular format.
