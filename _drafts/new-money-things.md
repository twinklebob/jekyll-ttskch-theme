The last few weeks some exciting changes have been happening in my wallet. No wait. Don't go! This post might actually be interesting, but it's hard to know where to start the story.

A part of the way we manage our finances is to separate the money into different accounts. This means that I can be juggling a few different cards, not to mention all the other cards in my wallet, but that's a subject for another blog post. It also used to mean a lot of transfers between accounts because we'd spend using the most convenient method, which doesn't always mean the correct account.

I've been playing around with a few different apps and things to help manage that and I've found a few things I really like.

In some ways the story started a few years ago when I first saw the [Coin card](https://hackernoon.com/r-i-p-plastc-and-coin-death-of-the-smartcard-industry-bc243cec913c) - an electronic card that could be made to act as any number of other debit or credit cards. Whilst that was probably doomed from the start, it raised the interesting question of how to do more with less.

The first one, which is the real reason I started writing this post, is Curve.
