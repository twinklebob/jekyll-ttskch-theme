At the beginning of the year I set myself 3 challenges and broke those down into mostly measurable goals (take a look at my [New Year Resolutions for 2019]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-01-02-new-year-resolution-2019.md %})).

The challenges were to **Read More**, **Write More** and **Play More**. It's hard to believe we're already over two thirds through February, so it's about time I gave you an update.

Let's start with the reading challenges - there were two parts to this one, the Goodreads annual challenge and reading through the Bible in a year.
