When you look at the culture of any period, it's possible to see influences from the past, and more often than not there's a roughly 30-year reach back into the past. During the 80s they looked back at the 50s, the 90s had some 6os influences (Britpop was heavily influenced by the 60s), I lost count of how many 70s parties I went to in the noughties and most recently we've been remembering the 80s through rose-tinted spectacles.

Of course now it's the 2020s and fashion is starting to look back to the 90s. Max BÃ¶ck writes about the [return of the 90s web](https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/) but quickly shoots down any return of the dancing baby.
