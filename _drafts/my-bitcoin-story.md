There's a good chance that you've heard about Bitcoin. It occasionally appears in the mainstream media, particularly when something really big or really bad happens, but there's a good chance you don't really understand it or how to do anything with it. I'm not going to go into it too deeply, as there are better guides at sites like [WeUseCoins.org][1] but I will do my best to provide some pointers for those of you who don't know much yet, as well as sharing my favourite sites and apps for those of you who are already interested.

## What is it

Bitcoin is an digital form of money which is based on trust and agreement, using complex mathematics to prove transactions. Unlike old forms of currency that were based on something like gold, Bitcoin's intrinsic value is it's process.

Every transaction is compiled and complex mathematical transactions and tests are applied to these until a satisfactory outcome is received.This proves the previous transactions and forms a "block", the machine (or machines) involved in this processing are rewarded with a Bitcoin which can then be used for further transactions. Gradually the blocks build up and become a chain of proven transactions, a **blockchain** (a term you might have heard before).

I would definitely recommend the resources on [WeUseCoins][1] as they explain the process a lot more simply and clearly than I can.

## What do I do with it

The reality is, I don't do a lot with it at all at the moment, although I'm always very interested in it. I started playing with Bitcoin fairly early on, around 2013, probably somewhere towards the middle of the "early adopters" stage of the [technology adoption curve](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=technology+adoption+curve).

I joined in at the time you could still mine bitcoins with GPUs and used an application to mine when the computer was idle, acting as part of a mining pool. I was able to collect <i class="fa fa-btc" aria-hidden="true"></i>3, worth more than $3500 at today's prices. Unfortunately I panicked when the price started seriously crashing and sold *all* of my bitcoins for around Â£60. When the price quickly recovered I tried to buy some back, but it was too late. The price never crashed that low again. I also haven't gone to the trading platforms since then, it was quite clear that I just don't understand that stuff enough!

My remnant sat untouched for quite a while and then I decided it was time to start looking again at what I could do with it.

### Wallet

Just like any other form of money, you need a way of carrying, spending and receiving bitcoins. These are called a wallet and come in a few different forms.

Since I got into this early I use a more complicated wallet than is probably necessary. I use the Android app [Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) which is a pretty basic pure network node. It makes it pretty secure, but also very easy to lose all your bitcoins if you don't keep a backup.

### Saving

One of the things I was pleased to find was a Bitcoin savings account, with interest. [Magnr*](https:/www.magnr.com/?r=85495) gives a 1.28% rate on funds of up to <i class="fa fa-btc" aria-hidden="true"></i>100.
