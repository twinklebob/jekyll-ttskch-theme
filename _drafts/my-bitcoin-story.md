There's a good chance that you've heard about Bitcoin. It occasionally appears in the mainstream media, particularly when something really big or really bad happens, but there's a good chance you don't really understand it or how to do anything with it. I'm not going to go into it too deeply, as there are better guides at sites like [WeUseCoins.org][1] but I will do my best to provide some pointers for those of you who don't know much yet, as well as sharing my favourite sites and apps for those of you who are already interested.

## What is it

Bitcoin is an digital form of money which is based on trust and agreement, using complex mathematics to prove transactions. Unlike old forms of currency that were based on something like gold, Bitcoin's intrinsic value is it's process.

Every transaction is compiled and complex mathematical transactions and tests are applied to these until a satisfactory outcome is received.This proves the previous transactions and forms a "block", the machine (or machines) involved in this processing are rewarded with a Bitcoin which can then be used for further transactions. Gradually the blocks build up and become a chain of proven transactions, a **blockchain** (a term you might have heard before).

I would definitely recommend the resources on [WeUseCoins][1] as they explain the process a lot more simply and clearly than I can.

## What do I do with it

The reality is, I don't do a lot with it at all
