I've been trying to go paper-free for a long time. I even wrote a couple of posts about [getting existing paper digitised](http://twinklebob.co.uk/almost-paper-free-part-2/) on the TwinkleBob blog.

Recently I turned my attention to reducing the amount of new paper I need to use, which is hard because I'm a scribbler.

<!--more-->

It all started with a bunch of adverts on Instagram for a device called [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com/). Once I'd made the mistake of clicking the link I was followed perpetually with adverts, and the adverts started to work.

The reMarkable tablet is an e-ink tablet, like those black and white ebook readers we saw a lot of a few years ago, except with two key differences (and some others): it has a stylus and it is almost the size of an A4 piece of paper!

The claim is that writing on it is like writing on paper. Anything you might do on paper, you should be able to do on one of these - except anything including colour!!

As I looked into it more, it turned out that there are a few tablets in this category. That means that they all have a larger screen (suitable for viewing A4 size PDFs reasonably clearly), ability to read ebooks and ability to take notes. After that the different devices have different additional abilities and specialities.

I was interested in a couple of things: firstly I wanted to be able to scribble and take notes, something I often do on the back of envelopes etc, secondly I wanted to be able to make notes on PDFs (particularly useful when processing a bank statement at the end of the month and being able to tick things off without printing it out) and thirdly I wanted to be able to synchronise with Evernote.

Looking at my requirements I decided that the [Onyx Boox Note Pro](https://onyxboox.com/boox_notepro) was the best match. It's running Android, has a front light on it's 10.3" screen, has pretty good note-taking abilities and allows you to write directly onto a PDF and for those annotations to be portable. It's not cheap, it was €524.98+VAT (about £452.50) when I bought it - depending on your needs you could get an iPad cheaper (and the latest ones support the Apple Pencil too), but I wanted to see if it was worth it.
