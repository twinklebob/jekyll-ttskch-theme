I don't know about you, but I'm pretty fed up with money. It seems like our entire lives is filled with the endless (and somewhat hopeless) pursuit for enough money to survive only for what we have to be taken from us in our old age, and as the saying goes "you can't take it with you".

I'm not a fan of capitalism, but it seems like we're stuck with it for the foreseeable future. So how can we live counter to that culture when it is so deeply embedded in the way our nation (and most of the world) work?

I came up with an idea, though. It involves wrapping the more "socialist" community in a capitalist bubble.

The first part is probably the hardest, but you'd need to buy a large collection of houses. Very occasionally a village goes up for sale, but you might have more luck buying a terrace in a poorer part of the country or perhaps a tower block somewhere.
