I don't know about you, but I'm pretty fed up with money. It seems like our entire lives is filled with the endless (and somewhat hopeless) pursuit for enough money to survive only for what we have to be taken from us in our old age, and as the saying goes "you can't take it with you".

I'm not a fan of capitalism, but it seems like we're stuck with it for the foreseeable future. So how can we live counter to that culture when it is so deeply embedded in the way our nation (and most of the world) work?
