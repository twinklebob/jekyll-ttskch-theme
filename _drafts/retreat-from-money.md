I don't know about you, but I'm pretty fed up with money. It seems like our entire lives is filled with the endless (and somewhat hopeless) pursuit for enough money to survive only for what we have to be taken from us in our old age, and as the saying goes "you can't take it with you".

I'm not a fan of capitalism, but it seems like we're stuck with it for the foreseeable future. So how can we live counter to that culture when it is so deeply embedded in the way our nation (and most of the world) work?

I came up with an idea, though. It involves wrapping the more "socialist" community in a capitalist bubble.

<!--more-->

Most people who decide to live a counter-culture life find that they need to increasingly remove themselves from the rest of the world, often depending on staying under the radar in order to get away with things that otherwise wouldn't be allowed. I'm trying to see if there's a middle ground.

The first part is probably the hardest, but you'd need to buy a collection of ajoining residences (and do so in compliance with planning permission etc). Very occasionally a village goes up for sale, but you might have more luck buying a terrace in a poorer part of the country or perhaps an old tower block somewhere. On a smaller scale you could just buy a few houses next door to each other, or buy a house with enough land to try seeking planning permission to build some additional dwellings.

The idea is that all of the property (and it's resulting costs) would be owned by a company, which is considered a legal entity. I haven't quite decided which the best structure would be, but I'm thinking either a co-operative or a community interest company (CIC).

Having purchased some property, you need to take it (or them) as off-grid as you can. Solar, wind, battery storage and rain-water collection can all help. Not only would you pay those companies less, you could also earn some money from sharing your spare electricity.

Another way you could collectively save money would be to share internet and telephone connectivity. One high-bandwidth internet connection shared amongst all the households and VoIP for the households that still want a landline (and not all of them will).

Each household would pay rent based on their ability to pay. So far I'm thinking a set token rent, say Â£10 per month, plus a fraction of their household monthly income after tax (say 35%). If there are different size dwellings I think there might need to be some sort of bedroom tax in order to be fair. If someone has the slightest justification for an extra room then it should be allowed. Whatever rent you pay, it would include everything - electricity, heating, internet. You'd probably have to pay your own council tax, unless there was a way for the company to negotiate with the council to take it all on - if you are populated empty dwellings, the council might be grateful for the extra regular cash.

I think there would need to be a community agreement to not claim benefits, except perhaps disability. For one, you'd have to pay rent on those benefits using the above calculations as per the rest of the community; also, you'd have an easier life than most of the other people claiming those benefits. This community would not be about getting rich, it would be about working together to make sure _everybody_ has what they need.

This means that if you want to work in a normal job, you can; if you want to stay at home, you don't have to worry about the cost. If you're an artist or creator you can do that without worrying about rent.

What would you do if you didn't need to work so much? I'd spend more time creating, learning things, gardening, playing with my son and being involved in his education. For me this is the dream utopia of a post-scarcity economy, freedom from slavery to money.
