Father of this Army, Captain of our soldiers
May Your glory fill the earth
As this world grows colder, may Your troops be bolder
May we fight with only love
May the crosses we bear be the weapons of our warfare
May we even more dare for You
May we even more dare for You
Let our uniform be holiness and mercy
Justice clothed with grace and truth
Those who speak be fearless, those who serve be blameless
Dreams old and visioned youth
Save us when we look past Jesus as an outcast
Shining, let us hold fast to You
Shining, let us hold fast to You
Breathe onto these dry bones, search the Spirit's deep groans
Speak into these calloused minds
Faith to make our dreams new, hope as we await You
Love to serve with joy and might
Onward to the conquest, north to south and east to west
Forward to the glorious fight of love
Forward to the glorious fight of love
Onward to the conquest, north to south and east to west
Forward to the glorious fight of love
Forward to the glorious fight of love
