Earlier this year I [set myself some goals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-02-new-year-resolution-2019 %}). You could call them new year resolutions if you want, but I purposefully avoided that as no one ever keeps their resolutions :wink:. I wanted to try and push myself to do some of the things that I always want to do but always find excuses not to do.

It's been a long time since I [last made an update]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-19-2019-challenge-february %}); the question is whether thats a bad sign or not? Let's take a look through my three goals: Read More, Write More, Play More.

## Read More

So I set myself the goal of reading 16 books this year, the biggest goal I've set myself in quite a while. I made a good start in the weeks/months following Christmas, but things really slowed down after that. My fifth book took me from the end of January until August sometime!! However I've managed to read another 5 since then!

10 books in a year is frankly pretty good going for me, I'm not sure how likely it is that I'll get the last 6 in. I don't really have to time to read at the moment, but who knows.

My Bible in a Year progress has been pretty similar; I've really enjoying doing it again! I had been doing fairly well up until a month or so ago. I'm now so far behind it seems hard to imagine catching up in time, which sucks.

The plan that we're reading through includes reading the Psalms 2.5 times through the year, so I'm going to skip those for a while until I've caught up, also there's a bit of free time at the end of the year, so maybe I can still do it.

## Write More

My aim was to write a minimum of one post a month and to maintain my journal.

I've written 11 posts this year, including this one, which averages out at one a month, but truthfully I kind of let this part of the challenge go the last few months. I really wanted to be a little more frequent and to keep a steady stream of content.

I still think I should be pleased with myself, though. I've got 11 posts so far this year (here's hoping for at least 12) which is almost the same as the last two years combined (12 posts across 2017 and 2018 on this blog). It's been my most productive year since 2009 - there were 23 posts on the old blog that year!

I'm not sure the content has always been of a high quality, or very interesting, but you can't have it all, eh?

The journal has been great, I've got a fairly good template that I use every week now and I find the whole thing really useful. It's lovely being able to look back to a certain date and see information about it, as well as having that plan of what's to come.

October was a pretty rough month, and I let the journal slip for the first time in a year. I felt a little lost without it, but I was struggling to get back up and running. I'm going again now, and fingers crossed I can keep it going.

## Play More

This one's always the hard one to measure. I wanted to make sure I had fun, that we as a family made time to play together. Even when things have been tough recently family time has been sacred. The hours between 5:30 and 8:30pm have been protected and so has the whole of the weekend.

We've had a lot of fun since my last update! I really should write a blog post about our holiday in Italy!
